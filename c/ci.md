## What is CI?
Continuous Integration is a practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. The aim of CI is to prevent integration problems. Intended to be used in combination with automated unit tests written through the practices of [test-driven development][tdd]. CI can include the use of build servers, which automatically run unit tests periodically and report the results to the developers.
